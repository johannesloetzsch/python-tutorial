# Python

Python is a beginner friendly [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) [script programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language).
It is [garbage-collected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)), so as a programmer you don't need to worry about the [memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management).
